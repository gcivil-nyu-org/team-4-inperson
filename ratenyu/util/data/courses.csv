222207,Civic Analytics and Urban Intelligence,CUSP-GX,7003,"Cities are increasingly data-rich environments, and data-driven approaches
to operations, policy, and planning are beginning to emerge as a way to
address global social challenges of sustainability, resilience, social
equity, and quality of life. Understanding the various types of urban data
and data sources – structured and unstructured, from land use records to
social media and video – and how to manage, integrate, and analyze these
data are critical skills to improve the functioning of urban systems, more
effectively design and evaluate policy intervention, and support
evidenced-based urban planning and design. While the marketing rhetoric
around Smart Cities is replete with unfulfilled promises, and the
persistent use (and mis-use) of the term Big Data has generated confusion
and distrust around potential applications. Despite this, the reality
remains that disruptive shifts in ubiquitous data collection (including
mobile devices, GPS, social media, and synoptic video) and the ability to
store, manage, and analyze massive datasets require students to have new
capabilities that respond to these innovations. *

*This course introduces students to computational approaches to urban
challenges through the lens of city operations, public policy, and urban
planning. Students are exposed to a range of analytical techniques and
methods from the perspective of urban decision-making. Issues of city
governance, structure, and history are presented to understand how to
identify and assess urban problems, collect and organize appropriate data,
utilize suitable analytical approaches, and ultimately produce results that
recognize the constraints faced by city agencies and policymakers. This is
not an easy task, and requires an understanding of urban social and
political dynamics and a significant appreciation of data governance,
privacy, and ethics. Specific attention is given to domain areas of energy
and building efficiency, transportation, public health and emergency
response, waste, water, and social connectivity and resilience, as well as
the deployment of urban technology at the neighborhood scale. The role of
civic engagement and community participation in the context of open data
and citizen science is explored, as well as the evolving relationship
between, and influence of, informatics on urban governance. Top-down and
bottom-up models of innovative service delivery are discussed and debated
in the context of public decision-making. Case studies and best practice

particular focus on New York City.*"

those who figure in your research, as well as those to whom the lessons are
later applied.

evaluate a project with these concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel
challenges for which there are often no easy answers or established
solutions. To do so, you will develop fluency in the key technical,
ethical, policy, and legal terms and concepts that are relevant to a
normative assessment of these novel analytic techniques. You will learn
about some of the common approaches and tools for mitigating or managing
the ethical concerns that these tend to provoke. And by exposing you to a
